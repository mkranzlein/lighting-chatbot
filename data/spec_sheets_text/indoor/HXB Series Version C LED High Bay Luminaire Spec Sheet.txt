1  Lumen maintenance values at 25 °C (77 °F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED 
package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen 
maintenance factors. 
2  In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are up to  
6x the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED.
3  Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
 * Data provided at 25˚C (77˚F). Actual wattage may differ by +/- 10% when operating between 120-277V or 347-480V +/-10%. Actual production yield may vary between -10 and +10% of initial delivered lumens
** Initial delivered lumen values based on luminaire without reflector. Refer to reflector Illumination Performance table for lumen multipliers when using reflector accessory
