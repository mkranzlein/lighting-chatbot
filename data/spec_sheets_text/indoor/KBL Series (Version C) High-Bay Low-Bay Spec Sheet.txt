SYNAPSE® SIMPLYSNAP INTELLIGENT CONTROL
The Synapse SimplySNAP platform is a highly intuitive connected lighting solution featuring 
zone dimming, motion sensing, and daylight harvesting with utility-grade power monitoring 
and support of up to 1000 nodes per gateway. The system features a reliable and robust self-
healing mesh network with a browser-based interface that runs on smartphones, tablets, and 
PCs. The integrated Synapse® Wireless Controller (SWC), Wireless Controller with Remote 
Sensor (SWR), and Wireless Controller with Network Sensor (SWS/SWSS) take the KBL Series 
to a new performance plateau, providing extreme energy productivity, code compliance and a 
better light experience.
KBL Series LED Low-Bay/High-Bay Luminaire - Version C
1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED  
  package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen  
  maintenance factors. 
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are
  up to 6x the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED.
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
