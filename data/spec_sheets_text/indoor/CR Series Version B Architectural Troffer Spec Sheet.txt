Product Specifications
SMARTCAST® TECHNOLOGY
SmartCast® Technology is the most intuitive and easiest to install intelligent light 
solution on the market. SmartCast® Technology delivers up to 70% energy savings 
at up to half the cost of other solutions. Luminaires combine best-in-class light with 
onboard sensors and intelligence to deliver a better light experience. Extreme energy 
productivity, code compliance and a better light experience without any extra design, 
installation or setup work.
CREE TRUEWHITE® TECHNOLOGY
A revolutionary way to generate high-quality white light, Cree TrueWhite® Technology is 
a patented approach that delivers an exclusive combination of 90+ CRI, beautiful light 
characteristics, and lifelong color consistency, all while maintaining high luminous 
efficacy – a true no compromise solution
CREE LIGHTING LED TECHNOLOGY
Cree Lighting's total systems approach to product development is a 
comprehensive engineering philosophy that combines the most advanced LED sources, 
driver technologies, optics and forms. The result is highly-reliable luminaire solutions 
for both indoor and outdoor applications that reduce energy use, extend lifetimes, and 
maximize illumination performance and quality.
ROOM-SIDE HEAT SINK
An innovative thermal management system designed to maximize cooling effectiveness 
by integrating a unique room-side heat sink into the diffusing lens. This breakthrough 
design creates a pleasing architectural aesthetic while conducting heat away from LEDs 
in a temperature-controlled environment. This enables the LEDs to consistently run 
cooler, providing significant boosts to lifetime, efficacy, and color consistency.
CONSTRUCTION & MATERIALS
• Durable 22-gauge steel housing with standard troffer access plate for electrical 
installation
• One-piece lower reflector finished with a textured high reflectance white polyester 
powder coating creates a comfortable visual transition from the lens to the ceiling 
plane
• Not for installation within 3" (76mm) of insulation
• Includes t-bar clips and holes for mounting support wires (by others)
• May be surface mounted or suspended w/surface mount kit accessory
• Individual luminaires may be mounted end to end for a continuous row of 
illumination
• Includes QR code on the back of the troffer housing which provides access to: Online 
installation instructions, Luminaire information (Part number, Serial number, Build 
date, and Warranty end date), and Warranty claim submission form
• Duplicate 1” and 2" QR code labels are included. 1" labels can be affixed next to 
fixtures, on site plans, or in maintenance records. 2” labels can be scanned from the 
ground when placed at an appropriate height
OPTICAL SYSTEM
• Unique combination of reflective and refractive optical components achieves a uni-
form, comfortable appearance while eliminating pixelation and color fringing
• Components work together to optimize distribution, balancing the delivery of high 
illuminance levels on horizontal surfaces with an ideal amount of light on walls and 
vertical surfaces. This increases the  
perception of spaciousness
• Diffusing lens integrated with upward-facing LED strip eliminates direct view of 
LEDs while lower reflector balances brightness of lens with the ceiling to create a 
low-glare high angle appearance

1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED 
package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen 
maintenance factors. 
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are
up to 6x the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED.
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
