VuePoint LED Low-Bay/High-Bay Luminaire
Product Description
VuePoint High Bay Series challenges the status quo, letting you forget about squint-inducing raw 
lumens, while preserving visual comfort and delivering category-leading performance. The VuePoint 
delivers remarkable energy savings and performance through its highly efficient and standard diffused 
optical assembly. With its clean, streamlined form factor and virtually maintenance free design the 
VuePoint provides substantially better light across industrial, warehouse, retail, athletic, auditorium, 
transportation and hangar environments in both new construction and retrofits.

VuePoint® Series LED Low-Bay/High-Bay Luminaire
1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED 
package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen 
maintenance factors.  
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are up to 6x 
the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED. 
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
Note: 30L is are rated up to 40˚C, 30L w/EB1 is rated up to 35˚C.
