1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED package and in-situ luminaire
  testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen maintenance factors.  
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are up to 6x the tested duration in the IES
  LM-80 report for the LED. 
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
