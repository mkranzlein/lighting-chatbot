Product Specifications
CREE TRUEWHITE® TECHNOLOGY
A revolutionary way to generate high-quality white light, Cree TrueWhite® Tech-
nology is a patented approach that delivers an exclusive combination of 90+ CRI, 
beautiful light characteristics and lifelong color consistency, all while maintaining 
high luminous efficacy – a true no compromise solution.
CONSTRUCTION & MATERIALS
• Durable upper housing protects LEDs and driver. Adjustable flip clips resist 
heat whil
e providing retention for flush ceiling fit
• Thermal management sy
stem uses the lower reflector to conduct heat away 
from LEDs and transfer it to the plenum space for optimal  
performance. LED junction temperatures stay below specified maximum even 
when installed in insulated ceilings
• Suitabl
e for insulated and non-insulated ceilings
• One-piece aluminum l
ower reflector redirects light while also  
conducting heat away from LEDs. It creates a comfortable visual  
transition from the lens to the ceiling plane and easily accommodates CRT4 
snap-in trims
OPTICAL SYSTEM
• Unique combination of r eflective and refractive optical components achieves 
a uniform, comfortable appearance while eliminating pixelation and color 
fringing. This ensures smooth light patterns are projected with no hot spots 
and minimal striations
• Components w
ork together to optimize distribution, balancing the delivery of 
high illuminance levels on horizontal surfaces with an ideal amount of light on 
walls and vertical surfaces. This increases the  
perception of spaciousness
• Diffusing poly
carbonate lens shields direct view of LEDs while lower  
reflector balances brightness of lens with the ceiling to create a low-glare 
high angle appearance
• Beam Angle (included angl
e between points of 50% of max. intensity): ~ 95o
• Field Angle (included angle between points of 10% of max. intensity): ~ 145o
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
• Integral, high-efficiency power supply
• Po
wer Factor: > 0.9
• Tot
