1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED
  package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen
  maintenance factors.
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are
  up to 6x the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED.
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
Product Specifications
CREE TRUEWHITE® TECHNOLOGY
A revolutionary way to generate high-quality white light, Cree TrueWhite® 
Technology is a patented approach that delivers an exclusive combination 
of 90+ CRI, beautiful light characteristics and lifelong color consistency, all 
while maintaining high luminous efficacy – a true no compromise solution.
CONSTRUCTION & MATERIALS
• Durable aluminum housing protects the light source. Adjustable flip 
clips provide robust retention for flush ceiling fit
• Thermal management system uses integral heat sink to conduct heat 
away from LEDs for optimal performance. LED junction temperatures 
stay below specified maximum even when installed in with worst case 
installations
• Suitable for insulated and non-insulated ceilings
• One-piece aluminum lower reflector redirects light while also 
conducting heat away from LEDs. It creates a comfortable visual 
transition from the lens to the ceiling plane and easily accommodates 
LXT4 snap-in trim
OPTICAL SYSTEM
• Unique combination of reflective and refractive optical components 
achieves a uniform, comfortable appearance while eliminating 
pixelation, hot spots and minimizing glare
• Components work together to optimize distribution, balancing the 
delivery of high illuminance levels on horizontal surfaces with an ideal 
amount of light on walls and vertical surfaces. This increases the 
perception of spaciousness
• Deep set polycarbonate diffusing lens shields direct view of LEDs and 
provides greater visual cut-off
• Beam Angle (included angle between points of 50% of max. intensity): 
~ 85o
• Field Angle (included angle between points of 10% of max. intensity): ~ 
140o
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
• Integral, high-efficiency driver and power supply
• Power Factor: > 0.9 (120V)
• Total Harmonic Distortion: < 20% (120V)
• Input Voltage: 120V - 277V Universal, 50/60Hz
• 120V is dimmable to 5% with most incandescent dimmers
• 277V is dimmable to 5% with most trailing edge dimmers
• Reference https://www.creelighting.com/products/indoor/retrofit-down-
lights/lrx-series for recommended dimmers
• Operating Temperature Range: -25˚C - +35˚C (-13˚F - +95˚F); 
For 18L: -25°C - +30°C (-13°F - + 86°F)
REGULATORY & VOLUNTARY QUALIFICATIONS
• cULus Classified
• Suitable for wet locations for covered ceilings only
• Meets CA Title 24 JA8 Requirements
• Meets CA Title 20 Appliance Regulations
• Meets FCC Part 15, Subpart B, Class B limits for conducted and radiated 
emissions
• RoHS Compliant. Consult factory for additional details
