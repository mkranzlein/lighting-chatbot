Product Specifications
CREE TRUEWHITE® TECHNOLOGY
A revolutionary way to generate high-quality white light, Cree TrueWhite® 
Technology is a patented approach that delivers an exclusive combination 
of 90+ CRI, beautiful light characteristics and lifelong color consistency, all 
while maintaining high luminous efficacy – a true no compromise solution.
CONSTRUCTION & MATERIALS
• Durable upper housing protects LEDs, driver and power supply.  
Adjustable flip clips resist heat while providing retention for flush  
ceiling fit
• Thermal management system uses both upper housing and lower 
reflector to conduct heat away from LEDs and transfer it to the plenum 
space for optimal performance. LED junction temperatures stay below 
specified maximum even when installed in insulated ceilings
• Suitable for insulated and non-insulated ceilings
• One-piece aluminum lower reflector redirects light while also  
conducting heat away from LEDs. It creates a comfortable visual  
transition from the lens to the ceiling plane and easily accommodates 
CRT6 snap-in trims
OPTICAL SYSTEM
• Unique combination of reflective and refractive optical components 
achieves a uniform, comfortable appearance while eliminating pixelation 
and color fringing. This ensures smooth light patterns are projected with 
no hot spots and minimal striations 
• Components work together to optimize distribution, balancing the 
delivery of high illuminance levels on horizontal surfaces with an ideal 
amount of light on walls and vertical surfaces. This increases the  
perception of spaciousness
• Diffusing polycarbonate lens shields direct view of LEDs while lower 
reflector balances brightness of lens with the ceiling to create a  
low-glare high angle appearance 
• Beam Angle (included angle between points of 50% of max. intensity): 
~ 95o
• Field Angle (included angle between points of 10% of max. intensity): ~ 
145o
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
• Integral, high-efficiency power supply
• Power Factor: > 0.9
• Total Harmonic Distortion: < 20%
• Input Voltage: 120V, 50/60Hz; 120-277V, 50/60Hz
• Dimming: Dimmable to 5% with select incandescent dimmers at 120V 
only. Forward phase (triac) and reverse phase dimming only. 
• Reference 
http://www.creelighting.com/products/indoor/retrofit-downlights/crt-
series for recommended dimmers
• Use only lighting controls with neutral connection or controls intended 
for use with LED fixtures
• Operating Temperature Range:  -25˚C to +35˚C (-13˚F - +95˚F)
REGULATORY & VOLUNTARY QUALIFICATIONS
• cULus Classified
• Suitable for wet locations for covered ceilings only
• Meets FCC Part 15, Subpart B, Class B limits for conducted and radiated 
emissions
• Meets CA Title 24 JA8 Requirements
• Meets CA Title 20 Appliance Regulations
• RoHS Compliant. Consult factory for additional details
