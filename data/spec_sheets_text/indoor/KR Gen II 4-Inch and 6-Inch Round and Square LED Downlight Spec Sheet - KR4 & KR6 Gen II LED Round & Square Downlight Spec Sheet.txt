1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED 
package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen 
maintenance factors. 
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are up to 6x 
the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED. 
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.

Photometry
KR6S40L9271210V W/KR6TSSSGCFF BASED ON RESTL TEST #: PL16890001B
Luminaire photometry has been conducted in accordance with IES LM-79. IES LM-79 specifies the entire luminaire as the source resulting in a luminaire efficiency of 100%.
