* Electrical data at 25˚C (77˚F). Actual wattage may differ by +/- 10% when operating between 120-277V +/- 10%
1 Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED 
package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen 
maintenance factors. 
2 In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are
up to 6x the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED.
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
