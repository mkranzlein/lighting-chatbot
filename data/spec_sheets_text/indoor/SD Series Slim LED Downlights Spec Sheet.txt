Product Specifications
CONSTRUCTION & MATERIALS
• Aluminum and iron downlight housing
• Remote mounted iron J-Box connects to downlight with  
a low voltage cable
• Includes housing clips for easy installation
• Suitable for ceilings 0.59” (15mm) to 0.79” (20mm) thick

OPTICAL SYSTEM
• Unique combination of optical components achieves a uniform, 
comfortable appearance while eliminating pixelation and color fringing. 
This ensures smooth light patterns are projected with no hot spots and 
minimal striations 
• Components work together to optimize distribution, balancing the 
delivery of high illuminance levels on horizontal surfaces with an ideal 
amount of light on walls and vertical surfaces.
• Edge-lit LEDs, plastic light guide plate and diffuser lens shields direct 
view of LEDs
• CCT is adjustable via a switch on the j-box in the field to meet the 
requirements of numerous applications
• Beam Angle: 113º (included angle between points of 50% of maximum 
intensity) 
ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
• Power Factor: > 0.9 at full load and 120V
• Total Harmonic Distortion: < 30% at full load
• Input Voltage: 120-277V, 50/60hz

1  Lumen maintenance values at 25˚C (77˚F) are calculated per IES TM-21 based on IES LM-80 report data for the LED 
package and in-situ luminaire testing. Luminaire ambient temperature factors (LATF) have been applied to all lumen 
maintenance factors.
2  In accordance with IES TM-21, Reported values represent interpolated values based on time durations that are up to 6x 
the tested duration in the IES LM-80 report for the LED.
3 Estimated values are calculated and represent time durations that exceed the 6x test duration of the LED.
